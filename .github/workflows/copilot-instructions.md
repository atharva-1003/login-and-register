# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This project is a lightweight frontend web application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. 
It runs entirely in the browser without any backend or external dependencies.

The application structure is simple and organized:
- index.html – Contains the main HTML structure.
- style.css – Handles styling and layout.
- script.js – Contains all client-side logic and interactivity.

The goal of this project is to maintain clean, readable, and easily extendable code while keeping the implementation minimal and efficient.

## How to Contribute
- Follow the existing code style and formatting.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and modular.
- Avoid global variables unless necessary.
- Do not introduce external libraries unless required.
- Write clear comments for complex logic.
- Test all changes in the browser before submitting a PR.
- Ensure there are no console errors.
- Maintain separation between structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JS).
- Run manual tests for all interactive features before submitting PRs.

## Key Technologies
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive layout
- JavaScript (ES6+) for client-side functionality
- Git and GitHub for version control
- GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development

No additional setup or build tools are required. 
To run the project locally, simply clone the repository and open index.html in a web browser.
